<blockquote><div><cite>Joshua_x wrote:</cite><br />What should I look for to be sure it is in good condition? And if I get one in good condition, how do I keep it that way and prevent the stick from wearing down?<br /></div></blockquote><br /><br />What's worked for me in the past is looking for pictures of the controller at an angle where you can see under the stick. <br /><br />Usually a controller that is badly looked after/heavily used will have a lot of white dust built up under the stick. If there are no pictures, send a message to the seller and ask for one. Also make sure the stick actually stands up-right, this can take a sharp eye but if the stick seems to lean in any specific direction it most likely means it's worn out.<br /><br />There isn't really a way to prevent the stick from wearing down other than doing Bowser throws excessively or playing dumb games like Mario Party. Before I got a Hori I just used to practice everything but Bowser throws with my controller rather than doing runs. <br /><br />All that being said though, even half-decent sticks should generally last you a long time and, even as it wears down, you'll automatically adjust to it through playing a lot with it. It's only when you start to see it affecting your moment where you know it's at its final moments.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://marioruns.com/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=2">Denotu</a> — 19 Oct 2014, 03:08</p><hr />

My first N64 controller I bought was absolutely horrendous. It took at least 6 spins to get Bowser spins to full speed. I stopped playing it and went back to VC until I got another 15 bucks I could waste and bought a new controller. Although it worked really well, my hands hurt after each session because the controller is so cramped when compared to the GC controller.<br /><br />I stopped being a little bitch and got over it, though.<br /><br />(btw, don't look for &quot;tight stick&quot; when looking for controllers.

When I first switched to N64, I didn't like using the controller at all. I'd used Xbox controller on emu for I think 9 months and everything felt weird. I couldn't actually spin the stick at first because I didn't want to fuck up the stick. Now I feel like other controllers are weird and the lack of notches on other controllers like playing a game on PS4 for example feels strange IMO. Only downside to them is the stick wearing down and in your case it would seem like your stick sucks.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://marioruns.com/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=125">GothicLogic</a> — 18 Oct 2014, 20:15</p><hr />

Sounds like your controller isn't very good. Random controller failures are signs of an overused joystick, or one that has been tampered with. Apart from that, part of it might be your attitude towards the controller. Obviously the joystick on a controller that is from 1996 will not match up to the joysticks we have today, but I think it's something that (if you have a decent one) isn't too bad to get used to. Depending on how much money you are willing to spend you could check out getting a Hori Mini Pad or just a gamecube style replacement stick (see this: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Redesigned-REPLACEMENT-Joystick-Controller-Thumbstick/dp/B009MRZAUC/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1413654604&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=n64+replacement+joystick" class="postlink">http://www.amazon.com/Redesigned-REPLACEMENT-Joystick-Controller-Thumbstick/dp/B009MRZAUC/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1413654604&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=n64+replacement+joystick</a>), although the replacement joystick may not fix your random controller failures, as I still have to very occasionally unplug and replug mine.<br /><br />The price we pay to have real times...<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://marioruns.com/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1515">minikori</a> — 18 Oct 2014, 18:52</p><hr />

I used to play from late 2011-early 2013. It's been almost 2 years since I've made a serious attempt at SM64 speedrunning. I mostly played emulator and I recently decided to switch to N64 and de-rust at the same time, and switching to N64 is very discouraging. The lag is a big downside, but the controller is the worst part. The joystick feels awkward and uncomfortable to the point of it ruining the game for me, speedrunning-wise. The seller on eBay for that controller said that the joystick was tight, but I still experienced unexpected joystick failures, such as Mario suddenly running slowly. Knowing that I have to stress over the controller being in good condition to speedrun the game is disappointing. Even when the joystick is good quality, the controller still feels awkward and the game hard to play compared to other controllers I've used, with fast Bowser throws being nearly impossible. Has anyone faced this discouragement and gotten past it? The game is fun and perfect for speedrunning, but for now I'm giving up on it and switching to SMS.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://marioruns.com/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1497">Joshua_x</a> — 18 Oct 2014, 18:03</p><hr />
