I think I probably have just over 2000. <br /><br />It's probably unfair to compare a game like Goldeneye, which primarily focuses on IL WRs, and SM64, where all the English players only care about full game runs. Full game runs are going to take less time to get good at, and when you factor in the RNG that a lot of WRs have that ruin good IL runs in GE, your estimation of how many hours it takes for a game to be considered competitive is going to be unfairly inflated.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://marioruns.com/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=72">BebopBandit</a> — 18 Sep 2014, 20:28</p><hr />

I have no clue how many hours I've logged. I got this game when it came out on N64 and played it every day for a very long time. I got 120 stars a couple of times and generally just knew so much about it. I started speed running the game a few months ago, so since then, I've logged hundreds of more hours.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://marioruns.com/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1530">SphericalCrusher</a> — 16 Sep 2014, 13:56</p><hr />

I actually wish I had a fair estimate of how much I've spent into this game, it's either between 1700-2100 hours as of now and I feel like improving my 120 star PB is not something that will happen soon (but I may be wrong on this one)l. But if toastrider really played around 2000 hours and is down to a 1:45 then that is very very impressive and I'm way out of his league.<br /><br />This is my first post, lol... Guess it was time that I made an account here so I'm a part of this community in a way or another.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://marioruns.com/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1485">Haliinen</a> — 22 May 2014, 15:03</p><hr />

i feel like its almost impossible to estimate hours played unless you have a schedule where you played the exact same amount every day since youve started but of course no one does that. everyone takes breaks sometimes and have days where they play a lot and days where they dont play at all so its really hard to say, but id probably have to say somewhere between 1000-2000 hours for me. thats not even close to a specific estimate but as i said i have no idea lol  <img src="http://marioruns.com/forum/images/smilies/rwgLIGHTS.png" alt="rwgLIGHTS" title="rwgLIGHTS" />  <img src="http://marioruns.com/forum/images/smilies/rwgLIGHTS.png" alt="rwgLIGHTS" title="rwgLIGHTS" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://marioruns.com/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=69">toastrider</a> — 18 May 2014, 01:50</p><hr />

As an estimate I would say about 500-800 hours. I have over 200 hours played in other games such as final fantasys and kingdom hearts. I think my estimate is pretty accurate, i started playing early 2013 and nearly everyday. I think my skill level personally isnt close to where it should be for the amount of time I have put into this game. But it is fun and addicting so i can never quit x)<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://marioruns.com/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1407">Hafus</a> — 17 May 2014, 09:16</p><hr />

I've been playing on and off since Feb 2013, but I have no idea how many hours I've played. I guess I will start keeping track. My times are still pretty bad so it will be interesting to see how long it takes for me to get decent if I'm motivated.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://marioruns.com/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=63">Krygowski</a> — 17 May 2014, 03:21</p><hr />

I have been driving this discussion a bit lately.  I state that if you can become a Top 10 quality player in your speedgame in under 3000 hours, it's not a competitive speedgame.  I know that SM64 is one of only a handful of actually competitive speedgames, so am I off?  I could consider revising the statement to about 2000 hours, but I'm sure everyone here agrees that if you can become Top 10 in under 1000 hours your speedgame is a joke.<br /><br />Toastrider claims &quot;way less than&quot; 3000 hours played, and Haliinen concurs.  I consider Top 10 to having &quot;Top 10 times or obviously capable of such in both 120 and 70 star&quot; but maybe that's not a great criteria as a fair few 120ers don't care about 70?<br /><br />Anyways, post estimates of your the hours you've played SM64.  I especially am interested in hearing from top players.<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://marioruns.com/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1412">RWhiteGoose</a> — 16 May 2014, 21:12</p><hr />
