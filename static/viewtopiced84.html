				<div class="content">I have no clue how many hours I've logged. I got this game when it came out on N64 and played it every day for a very long time. I got 120 stars a couple of times and generally just knew so much about it. I started speed running the game a few months ago, so since then, I've logged hundreds of more hours.</div>

				<div class="content">I think I probably have just over 2000. <br /><br />It's probably unfair to compare a game like Goldeneye, which primarily focuses on IL WRs, and SM64, where all the English players only care about full game runs. Full game runs are going to take less time to get good at, and when you factor in the RNG that a lot of WRs have that ruin good IL runs in GE, your estimation of how many hours it takes for a game to be considered competitive is going to be unfairly inflated.</div>
