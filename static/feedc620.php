How many people usually do this per week? I would really like to participate but at that time I'm generally unavailable due to work. I know someone who may also want to participate too and he might actually be able to do it. For me if it were moved to a different time or day that'd be cool<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://marioruns.com/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1557">bakedpotato12</a> — 05 Dec 2014, 06:42</p><hr />

<img src="http://marioruns.com/forum/images/smilies/brew.png" alt="CheekyBrew" title="CheekyBrew" /> This is an advertisement thread for a weekly 70 star race on SRL.  <img src="http://marioruns.com/forum/images/smilies/brew.png" alt="CheekyBrew" title="CheekyBrew" /> <br /><br /><br />The tentative time for this race will be 3pm EST (EDT, depending on the time of year) every Saturday. Originally, this was another iteration of the &quot;weekly&quot; 120 races, but after it died off for the nth time, I thought it might be worth trying 70 star this time around.<br /><br />This is for people of all skill levels, so don't be afraid to join cause you think you won't be competitive. The longetivity of these weekly races seems to hinge on momentum, so the bigger these races are each week, the more likely it'll continue the next week. <br /><br />Also, we can always do a 120 race afterwards if anyone is up for it. <img src="http://marioruns.com/forum/images/smilies/sausage.png" alt="Sausage" title="Sausage" /><p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://marioruns.com/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1509">Alaris</a> — 23 Nov 2014, 22:05</p><hr />
