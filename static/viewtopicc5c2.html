				<h3>Banned for no SM64</h3>

				<div class="content">This is an issue that I have to call bullcrap on. At about 9:30 or so in the morning, I started to stream me learning the speed running strats on Super Mario Galaxy, while other people were playing SM64. They didn't mind that I played the game for a while. Then, at about 11:30, someone started playing Super Metroid. Nobody even minded him. I asked why, and they said that they allowed people to play casually sometimes, and I was OK with that. So, at about 12:15, someone asks me who I am and if I had a twitch. I gave them a link to my twitch. Then, I go afk for about 5 minutes and come back. While I was gone, the person that asked for my twitch said that I was just &quot;let's playing for attention&quot;. I came back and argued that I was learning new strats for Super Mario Galaxy speed running. Then, everyone (and I mean everyone in the chat) ganged up on me and said to play SM64 or get out. I stood my ground, saying that someone was playing SUPER METROID, a game not even in the same franchise, and they were OK with it, but when I play Super MARIO Galaxy, they got all on my case. I didn't hear what they said next, because then someone BANNED ME, but they didn't ban the guy playing Super Metroid. Pls answer, wtf just happened? Is this a SM64 site or a general Mario game site. If it is a SM64 site, then change the title to Mario 64 Runs. If it isn't a SM64 site, PLS TELL ME WHY THEY BANNED ME!  <img src="images/smilies/biblethump.png" alt="BibleThump" title="BibleThump" /></div>

				<div class="content">The tinychat is an sm64 practice room. We have no problems with regulars sometimes playing other games, but when it is your first few visits to the practice room you should really play sm64. We've had problems before with people just using the tinychat to get attention for their shitty games.<br /><br />You were also pretty obnoxious, and you were not learning to speedrun. It was very obviously a casual playthrough. &quot;How do I get out of the bubble.&quot; <br /><br />Bans in tinychat are temporary (unfortunately), so in a week or so when it wears off you'll be allowed back, provided you stop being annoying and play sm64.</div>
