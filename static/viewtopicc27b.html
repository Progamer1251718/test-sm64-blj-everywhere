				<div class="content">I was looking over the doc and I have a few questions about Eyerok.<br /><br />First, why is the first text the one that has the smallest difference between Jp and US? I guess it doesn't matter if that's supposed to be the text when you kill him, but it's just weird that it was listed that way.<br /><br />Second, holy shit. Does it really save 7 seconds there on Jp? That doesn't seem right at all. Is my math bad? (354-128)/30 I know it's a lot but Jesus H. I don't even feel like I'm standing there for 7 seconds, nevermind that it it supposed to save that much.<br /><br />Plus it looks like an additional second even on the shorter text box? 268-228 = 40 frames. What the hell.</div>

				<div class="content">Good you're asking questions. First off it's /60 as mupen counts the frames up by 2 each time not 1. HOLY SHIT, I fucked up math. It was supposed to be 128 not 228. Shit this bumps up the time quite a bit goodlooking out Bebop, now the time is roughly <br />EDIT: I fucked up Eyegore calculations so now J is only 3 seconds faster?</div>

				<div class="content">It seems like there's no entry in the doc for the text in Snowman's Lost His Head in CCM. I don't know the frames, but on JP the first text has 3 boxes and the second has 2 boxes, while on English the texts each have 1. Unless I've somehow overlooked it in the doc, it seems like JP overall saves less than 2 seconds.</div>
