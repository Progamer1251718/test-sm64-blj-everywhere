				<div class="content">Hello.  I've been interested in playing some Mario 64 lately, but unfortunately I do not have my N64 any more.  I learned that I could hook up my Wiimote/Nunchuk to my PC using bluetooth and play on an emulator.  However, I am having an issue with this.<br /><br />I have been able to connect my controller and use it to play, but the analog stick does not register analog inputs.  Essentially, what I mean is that even though I'm using an analog stick, it's being inputted into Project64 as W/A/S/D.  This basically makes it so I'm playing with a D-pad and not an analog stick.  Does anyone know if there are any fixes to this?  If I'm going to use an analog stick, I want analog stick inputs, because being essentially limited to moving in 8 directions makes controls pretty miserable.  Sorry if I've explained myself badly.  Hopefully someone can help.  Thanks.</div>

				<div class="content">windows has built in xbox controller support so the analog works fine after plugging it in. ps3 needs a driver but then it works perfectly and idk about the logitech one. your problem might be because you need a wiimote driver but i wouldnt recommend trying to play mario with that shit controller unless youre just gonna do a lets play or something lol<br /><br />imagine playing double dash with the wii wheel thing  or something lmao</div>

				<div class="content">Sorry for deviating from the topic, but really, playing with a wiichuck won't be useful no matter what what you wanna do with this game. In fact it will only screw you over.<br />Get some USB controller and you'll have no issues with mapping buttons ever, and who knows, maybe in the future you're interested in getting the N64 gear and it will be much easier to adjust (because you won't ever have to use a Z-style button for A or B). Life is unpredictable, we can only know what we feel right now, and make a guess about the future.</div>
