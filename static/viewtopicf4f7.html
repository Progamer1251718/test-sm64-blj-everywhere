				<div class="content">Do most people learn by simply watching WRs and trying their best to copy them?<br /><br />Even in Siglemic's tutorials he doesn't explain the mechanics- for example at the start to get Lakitu skip, what am I aiming for?  Did I miss because I didn't have enough speed? Because I didn't do a second long-jump soon enough? Because I wasn't far left enough? Because I needed to be further down the bridge before I started my second jump?<br /><br />Or for the bomb glitch on the first star.  Does the angle matter, does how soon you re-pickup the bomb matter, where do you hold your control stick for the optimal angle, etc etc there are a million questions that go unanswered.<br /><br />If guides like this simply don't exist then that is okay, I will learn on my own.  But I figured since this game is so big in the speedrunning community that there would be information like this around</div>

				<div class="content">There are some videos on YT that do have this information but yes you'd expect there to be more info readily available. For Lakitu skip there is a video on YT: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0aY_HY48zQ" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K0aY_HY48zQ</a><!-- m --> ..In regards to bomb clip, you want to be able to throw the bomb so to get backwards momentum to clip through, so Mario facing perpendicular to the cage, essentially. For grabbing the bomb, when you throw it, the more time you take to re-grab, the bigger the bomb will be due to it being in explosion animation. Big bomb is preferred so waiting longer to grab is better, but is close to exploding so timing practice is necessary.<br /><br />People normally watch videos of strats with controller inputs then spend time practicing and learning through trial and error and then finally understanding the trick. Don't just watch top players or their videos, I recommend to watch other new players also and see what strats they use, otherwise you're gonna be trying strats that you can't do and make it harder for yourself. If you do have any more questions regarding why or what, come into the practice room some time, people will answer them there.</div>

				<div class="content">Thanks for bringing this up. I'm actually in the stages of redesigning the entire guides section of the website to answer most of the questions runners may have when they pick up this game for the first time. <br /><br />The page will start from the ground up, beginning with version information, a FAQ section, followed by an informative 16 Star Guide with examples of how certain tricks are done at the beginning of the game (Lakitu Skip, Bomb Clip, Owlless and so on).<br /><br />Good luck with learning the game, though. SM64 is a great game to speedrun.<br /><br />And don't forget there's always people here on the forums to help you out if all else fails.</div>

That reminds me I was going to make some tutorials for 120 stuff for newbies like DDD100 sub part but I'm lazy so it'l never happen  <img src="images/smilies/sausage.png" alt="Sausage" title="Sausage" /></div>

				<div class="content">I learn by doing. I started running SM64 16-star a few months ago. I watched a ton of runs, but starting off, I made a route that worked best for me. My time was like 45 minutes lol. Right now, I've changed up a lot of stuff and my PB is 34 minutes. Still not great, but getting better with time. I don't use any glitches except Mips and BLJ, so I have to practice those. But yeah, one thing at a time. You want to get good at simply playing the game before you can run it!</div>
