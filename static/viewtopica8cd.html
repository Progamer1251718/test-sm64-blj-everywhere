The arrows keys are the same (IJKL) and C left/right are the same (UO), but I put C down at H and C up at ;. and R I put at V.<br /><br />The C left/right keys are superior when you put them like that, much easier than moving your hand off the arrow keys to reach them.</div>

				<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>vegard wrote:</cite>I thought it might be worth posting this (Pokeblok's keyboard layout): ...</div></blockquote><br />I must say, I'm rather upset that you would post my keybindings here without so much as a single message.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I am still happy to help with any questions / strats you need help with regarding keyboard running. I have also made a keyboard input display which can show off your own keybindings. l can help you make an overlay for it, should you choose to use it.<br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>sicko wrote:</cite>if you play on keyboard you're actually the dumbest person alive and will be banished from the community</div></blockquote><br />If this is serious, then I have lost my respect for you, and any others holding the same opinion.<br /><br />People have different reasons for choosing to use a keyboard instead of a controller. Personally, I couldn't wait for getting a controller to start speedrunning, so I began using my keyboard, and now I'm used to it. I like the 'challenge'.<br /><br /><blockquote><div><cite>Hafus wrote:</cite>When you are spinning bowser with keyboard you can hold down left and keep pressing right and he will spin :)</div></blockquote><br />This is one of the very few keyboard only tricks. Different keybindings / emulators have variations on this which allow you to do it (in my case, I hold right and tap left). It's still good to know how to spin the 'proper' way though.<br /><br />Playing using a keyboard is not as hard as people think. It mainly takes getting used to, with a few tricks to learn, just like everything else. I guess this is an indication that I could consider making a guide.<br /><br />Please contact me if you're really serious about keyboard running and want to know more.</div>

I can remove it if you want.<br /><br />Vegard</div>
