I'm not sure about the lag, but a GameShark Pro 3.0 is fine. Any 3.x will effectively be the same for SM64 practice, the later versions only really add support for more games (they also have a parallel port on the back).<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://marioruns.com/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1488">abitalive</a> — 13 Jul 2015, 00:26</p><hr />

Hi guys<br /><br />I've been watching Mario runs for a long time so I know that the game lags like hell in areas and there are camera strats to reduce the lag, but I've been surprised by how much I'm seeing now that I'm actually using an N64 myself. I don't know whether the amount I'm seeing is normal and maybe I just suck at reducing it, or if maybe there's something wrong with the console itself. Has someone documented the areas in the game known for lag spikes? Would be nice to make sure I'm not getting too much (think I might be paranoid cause the console was super cheap).<br /><br />Also I just ordered a gameshark 3.0 before I realised that there were subversions 3.2 and 3.3 etc. Is a 3.0 suitable for Mario codes?<br /><br />Thanks<br /><br />edit:<br /><br />Not seeing anywhere near as much lag anymore. I moved my n64 from the floor thinking it may have been ventilation (I didn't have anywhere to put it when I got it). The lag is significantly reduced. Hopefully this is because of the ventilation and not just because I haven't had the console turned on for long. Maybe I need to clean it out?<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://marioruns.com/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1599">allanry</a> — 12 Jul 2015, 18:01</p><hr />
