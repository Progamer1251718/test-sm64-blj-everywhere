				<div class="content">Yo,<br /><br />Over the past few weeks I have been putting together some new features on MarioRuns. I built them mainly to improve user experience. It's nothing really fancy. Here's what's new anyway:<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">New Leaderboard System (with a verified/unverified section)</span><br />Submitted times are now automatically updated onto the leaderboards. For new submissions, video evidence is now required to prevent fake times. The times from the old leaderboards will be imported into the new system as &quot;verified&quot; entries as I personally have reviewed them. Submissions will by unverified by default until a moderator reviews the submission. More about that below.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">User profiles</span><br />User profiles will work in conjunction with the automated leaderboards. You can sign up by clicking <a href="../signup-2.html" class="postlink">here</a> where you can get your own MarioRuns profile. You can add your Twitch/Twitter/Youtube links on your profile page as well as upload a user avatar and, of course, SM64 PBs. These profiles are external from the forums, though, because the two use entirely different databases, so you will essentially have two accounts.<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Moderators</span><br />Moderators have the ability to verify times and add times on another runner's behalf. Moderators will have their own dashboard on their profile page with a list of times that other people have submitted. I'll need a handful of moderators to review and verify these times regularly. Just send me a PM on the forums if you're interested in doing this.<br /><br />Hopefully this new system will solve some issues. With the website getting more popular everyday, it's becoming more difficult for me to handle the leaderboards by myself. This automation means no more waiting for your time to be updated, which I think is pretty cool.<br /><br />Oh, almost forgot - here's what to expect in the future:<br /><br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Single Star Leaderboards</span> (now that automation is here)<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Revamped Guides Section</span> (guides written on the website itself)<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Streams Page Revamp</span> (no more offline streams)<br /><span style="font-weight: bold">Long Coding Break for Denotu</span> (and maybe a girlfriend)<br /><br />Cheers.</div>
