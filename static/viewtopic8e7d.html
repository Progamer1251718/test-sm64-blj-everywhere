If you do it in your runs, it's an RTA strat. If you don't do it in your runs, it shouldn't be on the leaderboard.<br /><br />This applies for everything. If you do really fast double jump kicks on TTC 100 at the beginning in practice, but you don't try to be that optimized in runs, then that time shouldn't be on the leaderboard.</div></blockquote><br /><br />I don't like the definition of RTA strats to be that picky.  If its something that is RTA viable and not something you'd see in a wr video then you should be allowed to post it.  I sometimes don't like to do the wk's in boo hunt, so should I be allowed to post a time that does them?</div>

				<div class="content">The elite model seems very good. Putting each course on the lines, and the 6 stars* + RTA total in the columns, both for the leaderboards and for each player. Not sure what the relevant digit would be tho (decimals, 100's). Like, someone getting a UWR with a 0.01 second difference would be kinda ridiculous, I don't know if there's any other game besides perhaps SMB in which the second digit is relevant for optimization... (I might be absolutely wrong about this tho)<br /><br />*my suggestion is to put the 6 stars with no 100c, and the RTA total separated (one of the stars along with the 100c), so there's no strat mix up in the leaderboards, and the 100c star alone time isn't relevant anyway, so just sum it to the total course time where it actually matters.<br /><br />I don't know what would work for the secret courses though (or if their leaderboards would ever exist). I think if they would be timed, bowser stages would not count the throws, ending the timer when you enter the pipe (separating any% and with reds, or just put the red coins time since they're the most relevant).</div>

				<div class="content">What do you mean the 100 coin star time isn't relevant? If anything it's the time it takes from the 100 coin star to the other star which isn't relevant because theoretically it should be the same every time. E.g. when talking about the 1:01 route in WF, it is 1:01 to the 100 coin star, not to the red coin star....also, in terms of Bowser stages, times are already not including throws, if done with reds, it is the time it takes for to collect the red coin star, everything after is irrelevant. If done without reds,it is from when you enter the pipe (I think something like the point in which the black transition comes on to the screen is the point of timing, not too sure on that though). Yeah. :)</div>

				<div class="content">I was imagining if there were &quot;100coin star alone&quot; ranks, and to get faster time some of the the routes wouldn't include one of the other 6 (like, skipping a red coin, or a secret, or finishing far from the star that would've been grabbed right after), which is kinda pointless for full game runs.<br />But then again, there are other things that are irrel as well, such as doing the big house in the sky without 100's...</div>
