				<h3>Is sub 1:40 possible on VC?</h3>

				<div class="content">Greetings everyone! I used to speedrun Mario 64 back almost 5 years ago, when the world record was still 2:09:xx. I managed to pull a 2:42:xx a few times before I finally, slowly began to put the game down. Well, five years later, I'm back again, and really considering giving it another go. There's a lot of new strats, a lot of new faces, and plenty of new things to tackle; it all feels a bit overwhelming when I think about it.<br /><br />I used to run on VC, which will be what I'll be trying this time around. I know that VC is supposed to be a minute and 30 seconds faster than N64, but will it be enough with the current strats? I remember someone in puncayshun's chat saying that the sum of his best splits added up to 1:41:xx, which leads me to believe that it could be humanly possible. But I assume most of you here have a better grasp on these concepts than I do. If it is possible, I'd want to make it my goal, even though VC isn't necessarily recognized,at least not in a positive light, within the community.<br /><br />So, what are your thoughts?</div>

				<div class="content">Hi,<br /><br />VC is around 3 minutes faster for 120 star. Therefore it is certainly possible to get 1:40. I believe, though, that you are underestimating the skill and dedication it takes to reach that level. It would take you thousands of hours, and it wouldn't really be realistic as a (short term) goal.<br /><br />Unless you're willing to put in 8 hours a day for the next year, don't think about getting 1:40. Think about getting sub 2 first maybe.</div>

				<div class="content">well I think VC is one version that the majority of speedrunners don't use, so your competition in it would be a less than say on N64. If the VC was the standard version then it'd have a lot better time than it has now (1:43:22).  <br /><br />Like say the all the exact movements in the current N64 WR at 1:42:41.32 were done on the VC: it would definitely be 1:40 pace (maybe even 1:39 pace) just because the VC is so much faster. But you would have to be at Puncayshun's skill level AND on the VC. <br /><br />I'm not saying it is impossible but like Joeys said you would pretty much have to go overboard in your speedrunning practice and devote an extremely large amount of time to doing it.</div>
