				<div class="content">Hi,<br /><br />I'm Haliinen and I'm 22 years old from Sweden. <br /><br />I like to speedrun Super Mario 64. I started to go seriously with the game back July 2013 when I got on N64. Before that I used to do 16 star speedruns casually on emulator for around a month or something back May 2012 then I took a year long break and decided to pick this game up again when I got my N64 (I played other games back then and didn't really put focus on SM64 like I do today). I'm trying to achieve really good times so I practice a decent amount every day.<br /><br />My personal bests are as of now 1:47:13 in 120 star, 50:45 in 70 star and 17:44 in 16 star (I don't care much about this category really though I'm obviously going to improve that someday).<br /><br />That's about it I guess.<br /><br />Have a good day! <img src="images/smilies/simChomp.png" alt="simChomp" title="simChomp" />  <img src="images/smilies/sausage.png" alt="Sausage" title="Sausage" /></div>

I started to go seriously with the game back january 2012 when I got on emulator. Before that I used to casually masturbate furiously 10 times each night until my dick fell off and then respawned from my computer after talking to a fictional satan on emulator for around a month or something back december 2010 then I took a year long masturbation break and decided to pick this game up again when I got my emulamer (I masturbated to other pictures/videos back then and didn't really put focus on SM64 like I do today).
