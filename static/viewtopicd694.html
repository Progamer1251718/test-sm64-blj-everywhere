				<div class="content">dear all sm64 community all young fela and man .<br /><br />i present u as title say  , OCS :)  <img src="images/smilies/brew.png" alt="CheekyBrew" title="CheekyBrew" />  <img src="images/smilies/brew.png" alt="CheekyBrew" title="CheekyBrew" />  <img src="images/smilies/brew.png" alt="CheekyBrew" title="CheekyBrew" /> <br /><br /><br />ocs is my creation :) :)  <img src="images/smilies/brew.png" alt="CheekyBrew" title="CheekyBrew" /><br /><br /><br />i know ur questio is what is ocs:) <br /><br />ocs stands for<br /><br />Overall control of Sister<br /><br /> it is ranked by every sis u make or bang<br /><br />current ocs list rankings as of ending 2014 and early 2015 jan<br /><br /><br />1. alextolio ( a fucking legend )  over 10000 ocs scored during 2014 <br />this legend has been estimated that he banged and creatd 30 sis a day to achievve such a high ocs in only 1 year . Also its a honor to present and announce that he has made 2 proud sis for the famous and talended speedrunner LiveEggardo  <img src="images/smilies/brew.png" alt="CheekyBrew" title="CheekyBrew" />  thnx<br /><br />2.SethLJ <br />a student that started with ocs at mid june and has a tremondous progress , he has been attending ocs schooling by the legendary alexSM64 for the 3 months , estimated ocs is 8000 in 4 months ( willing to beat the legend????? ???????????? )<br /><br />3.Kyman<br />neew born talend wan tto fly vry high he has only 1000 but staratd ocs in september. He learns really slow , but didnt attend school of legend yet. Its probably the reason . <br /><br />4.Imrainh2o (patient)<br />Was willing to take a risk to put this disgrace in this epic legendary list. I did put him though , as a legend i had to take a risk to humiliate myself to this disgraceful name and ocs player<br />he started ocs at february 2014 , and has only 2 OCS since then . Why? , He refuses to take sis advices by the legend  <img src="images/smilies/brew.png" alt="CheekyBrew" title="CheekyBrew" /> , refused to go to school , and read sis book. <br />Important reason he is in the list is that he is one of my patients. Luckily i made him 20 sis his dad was live and caught me in the act , he was like : UR A FUCKING LEGEND KEEP GOIN .  i wink on him and increased my  <img src="images/smilies/brew.png" alt="CheekyBrew" title="CheekyBrew" />  as we proceed to the next patient . Live egg.<br /><br />5.disgraceful Live Egg<br /><br />1 ocs , banged his mum.<br /><br />OCS UPDATED RANKINGS , PROGRESS OF STUDENTS , RULES STUDENT HISTORY AND ACHIVEMENT, AND MORE... (OCS GIFTS???)  <img src="images/smilies/brew.png" alt="CheekyBrew" title="CheekyBrew" /> <br /><br /><br />1.alexander 10042 OCS<br />2.Seth 8033 OCS<br />3.Kyman 1021 OCS<br />4.Hitekaimerr 987 OCS<br />5.Noizeeh 532 OCS<br />6.Imrainh2o 2 OCS<br />7.LiveEgg <img src="images/smilies/brew.png" alt="CheekyBrew" title="CheekyBrew" /> 1 OCS<br /><br /><br />Lost patient history : Kevin(Noizeeh) Trobokolam( mozamvique player )<br /><br />History of a hidden ocs players that wasnt mentioned before.<br /><br />Kevin Noizeeh Trobokolam started his ocs carrier in 2014 octomber.He was tested to attempt to create a sis to the legendary no1 player alexander and he succeeded. Since then , he has been really busy with real life and couldnt be bothered to attempt to raise his OCS more , he has also created a sis to LiveEgg , just as all of patients , except Imrainh2o(exception $ ). Noizeeh is a really wise player , we hope that he cares more about ocs , he can be the alexander discrowner.<br /><br />Hitekaimerr Alexis Zebekim started his ocs carrier in december 15 2014,and he a great start. He has made the most sis to liveegg(25) beating alexander's prev record by 23 live egg sis that was set on august 10 2014. He has big plans bout ocs , and is willing to become one of the best.we hope the best for our young felea zebekim. heil zebkim<br /><br />OCS RULES(more to add)<br /><br />1.SRM40 sis repeating method over 40  is disqualified ( cant make over 40 sis to same person )<br />2.Faking SIS , faking sis is a commonly used cheat , patient use plastic doll covered with a box and they pretend that its real baby sis . This cheat is really disturbing and may get u banned from OCS<br />3.dad ocs    dad ocs is disqualified , u cant make sis or bro with dad. forget it</div>
