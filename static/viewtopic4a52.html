				<div class="content"><blockquote><div><cite>BebopBandit wrote:</cite>I like the way the controls feel (emu has input delay, absolutely horrendous lag in DDD if you're not cheating; VC is way too sensitive). But, mostly it's because this is the platform everyone else plays on. I don't understand why you would speedrun if you're not at least somewhat competitive, and I also don't understand why a competitive person would not want to play on an equal field. It blows my mind whenever I think about it.<br /><br />Like, I know the WR is 1:43:53. If I'm on VC and I have a 1:44 or whatever, I really don't know how I'm comparing to the most optimized run at all. Same with emu. I'm totally lost when trying to compare myself to other players. I hate that feeling. If I'm racing or I'm comparing PBs, I want the comparison to be as accurate as possible. I want to know with 100% certainty who I'm better than and who is better than me. If it's not accurate, I see no reason to even compare myself. And if there's no reason to compare myself to other players, then I see no real reason to be a part of the community at all.</div></blockquote><br />Pretty much sums up my thoughts</div>

				<div class="content">sm64 is an n64 game, playing it on a not-n64 is weak.<br /><br />Same goes for any other n64 game, unless the not-n64 version is identical to the n64 version.</div>
