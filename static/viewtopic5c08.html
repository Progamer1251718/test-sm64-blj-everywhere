				<div class="content">So I've been getting into speedrunning mario 64, and have really enjoyed it. Currently, I play on an American Wii and use VC to play, but wanted to get a Japanese N64 and run on that with a Japanese version of mario 64. Is there a certain website I should go to buy a Japanese N64, or will amazon or ebay  work just as well? Also, if it says Japanese Import, does that mean it's literally just a Japanese Import or  has it been modded in some sort of way? Sorry if these are stupid questions, I just want to make sure I'm buying exactly what I want. Thanks in advance!</div>

				<div class="content">Man you dont need a japanese n64(ntsc-j) to play a japanese copy of sm64. There are a couple ways to play japanese games on american/ntsc console.<br /> You can open a shitty game and the jap cart and switch the covers. <br />You can cut into the cart where the restrictive holes are(dont reccomend). <br />You can use a gameshark(iffy when resetting on runs, but works nonetheless). <br /><br />The best solution in my opinion is a slight modification to your console. Here is a tutorial.<br /><!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNljGM3WOfs" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NNljGM3WOfs</a><!-- m --><br /><br /><br />As for where to buy stuff, just ebay.<br /><br /><br />Things with the title &quot;Japanese SM64&quot; and &quot;Japanese Import SM64&quot; are the same thing. Just make sure you dont buy the shindou version. I beleive it is also listed as &quot;Rumble Pak Version&quot;<br /><br />If you are going to play on console, also make sure you get a CRT tv. It makes a world of difference. Also if your tv has s video or you want to stream in s video i would recommend getting a n64 composite/s video cord.</div>

				<div class="content">Yo, so, i got my Japanese N64 on ebay back in october (i wanted to run OoT at the time) for around 110$ (really good quality, with good controller and with the original box), i got my japanese card on ebay as well for 15$ (okay quality, a bit dirty)<br /><br />If you want to practice, you should use a 3.x gameshark, i got my 3.2 gameshark for 30$ with an expansion pak to add more codes, you can get one for 25 to 35 on ebay, get an original one tho, the 3rd party ones doesn't work, here's a pic of an original one btw: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://puu.sh/gTzcj/ss%2b(2015-03-28%2bat%2b05.59.39).jpg" target="_blank">http://puu.sh/gTzcj/4e07b67c97.jpg</a><!-- m --><br /><br />If you have a NTSC one, just do hafus's trick, good luck man ;)<br /><br />NOTE: get THIS japanese version: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://puu.sh/gTzv0/ss%2b(2015-03-28%2bat%2b06.03.59).jpg" target="_blank">http://puu.sh/gTzv0/2b119513a3.jpg</a><!-- m --><br /><br />the other one is the patched version, also known as shindou edition, shindou look like this: <!-- m --><a class="postlink" href="http://puu.sh/gTzRW/ss%2b(2015-03-28%2bat%2b06.08.39).jpg" target="_blank">http://puu.sh/gTzRW/f4fa868096.jpg</a><!-- m --><br /><br />i personally call it the cancer edition lol.</div>
