				<div class="content">I have been driving this discussion a bit lately.  I state that if you can become a Top 10 quality player in your speedgame in under 3000 hours, it's not a competitive speedgame.  I know that SM64 is one of only a handful of actually competitive speedgames, so am I off?  I could consider revising the statement to about 2000 hours, but I'm sure everyone here agrees that if you can become Top 10 in under 1000 hours your speedgame is a joke.<br /><br />Toastrider claims &quot;way less than&quot; 3000 hours played, and Haliinen concurs.  I consider Top 10 to having &quot;Top 10 times or obviously capable of such in both 120 and 70 star&quot; but maybe that's not a great criteria as a fair few 120ers don't care about 70?<br /><br />Anyways, post estimates of your the hours you've played SM64.  I especially am interested in hearing from top players.</div>

I'm no top player but I can tell you that it took 143 hours to bring my 120 star time from 2:00:22 to 1:52:49</div>

				<div class="content">I've been playing on and off since Feb 2013, but I have no idea how many hours I've played. I guess I will start keeping track. My times are still pretty bad so it will be interesting to see how long it takes for me to get decent if I'm motivated.</div>

				<div class="content">As an estimate I would say about 500-800 hours. I have over 200 hours played in other games such as final fantasys and kingdom hearts. I think my estimate is pretty accurate, i started playing early 2013 and nearly everyday. I think my skill level personally isnt close to where it should be for the amount of time I have put into this game. But it is fun and addicting so i can never quit x)</div>

				<div class="content">i feel like its almost impossible to estimate hours played unless you have a schedule where you played the exact same amount every day since youve started but of course no one does that. everyone takes breaks sometimes and have days where they play a lot and days where they dont play at all so its really hard to say, but id probably have to say somewhere between 1000-2000 hours for me. thats not even close to a specific estimate but as i said i have no idea lol  <img src="images/smilies/rwgLIGHTS.png" alt="rwgLIGHTS" title="rwgLIGHTS" />  <img src="images/smilies/rwgLIGHTS.png" alt="rwgLIGHTS" title="rwgLIGHTS" /></div>

				<div class="content">I actually wish I had a fair estimate of how much I've spent into this game, it's either between 1700-2100 hours as of now and I feel like improving my 120 star PB is not something that will happen soon (but I may be wrong on this one)l. But if toastrider really played around 2000 hours and is down to a 1:45 then that is very very impressive and I'm way out of his league.<br /><br />This is my first post, lol... Guess it was time that I made an account here so I'm a part of this community in a way or another.</div>
