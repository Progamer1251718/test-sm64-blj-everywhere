				<div class="content">As SM64 is one of the games utilising the &quot;damsel in distress&quot; plot device, I thought this would be relevant:<br /><br /><object type="application/x-shockwave-flash" style="width:640px; height:360px;" data="http://www.youtube.com/v/X6p5AZp7r_Q"><param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/X6p5AZp7r_Q" /></object><br /><br />The other videos in the series are also worth watching.</div>

				<div class="content">I watched the video, and it's dumb. It picks out unnecessary things and mixes it with a bunch of other unnecessary things. It's all a plot to make the MEN feel bad about their games and their attitudes that they pick from it, although unbelievably, no one other than these people look at the games like this. Last time I checked I didn't play SM64 and think &quot;Fuck me, Peach is so weak, she keeps getting kidnapped all the time, typical women.&quot; What a joke.</div>

				<div class="content">I have to agree that she is a joke. Not just because of her ridiculous opinions and the manipulative language she uses, but because she raised $160k from a kickstarter to fund this video series on the basis that she will purchase, play, and review all these games herself, while it has been proven that she steals gameplay footage of let's players on youtube and uses them in her videos without giving them any credit. Also, comments are disabled on all her videos and she blocks anyone on all social media who attempts to criticize her in any way, or ask where the kickstarter money has gone. None of her videos show that she has done much of anything to put the money towards what donators in kickstarter thought they were putting money towards. She is more of a con artist than a feminist.</div>
