Hey Cory,<br /><br />I know how you feel being nervous about streaming and everything, I was the same way, but now I love streaming! After my first few streams, I got a lot less nervous and a lot more out-going, and met a lot of new people in the community, and it's one of my favorite hobbies now!<br /><br />Thanks,<br />Steve ^_^<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://marioruns.com/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1395">SteveGamesHD</a> — 04 Apr 2014, 15:59</p><hr />

Hey, I'm |3lue or or you can just call me Cory. I'm currently 22 years of age and reside in the Eastern US. I started my journey of speedrunning back in Jan of 2013. I started with OOT, but quickly transferred over to Mario. Over the span of the year, I practiced SM64 on and off. I started off with 16 star and the past few months I've been practicing 70. My practice started on the Project64 Emulator, but I couldn't stand using the 360 controller. I eventually ended up switching to VCheaters, the Gamecube controller allows me to easily go at the specific angles I need Mario to go in. I have not had a whole lot of courage to start streaming, but I have my Capture Card and X-Split ready. I get nervous easily and I don't do well under pressure. I guess this is one of those things that will help me overcome it..<br /><br />All the very well known streamers over the year have been a big inspiration to me. The community and them have shown me this game taken outside it's box.<br /><br />Thanks for reading!<p>Statistics: Posted by <a href="http://marioruns.com/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1399">|3lue</a> — 03 Apr 2014, 08:18</p><hr />
