				<div class="content">There's no kind of race function on Marioruns, except for private races in the tinychat. SRL accepts players of all skill levels, and you'd be much more likely to find someone you can compete with there than here or on tinychat.<br /><br />I'd also recommend you learn the proper route for 16 star. It takes some time to learn, but it is by no means impossible for even the newest of players.</div>

				<div class="content">I really don't know what you mean by your own route. You mean you want other players to do the exact same stars you do for 16 star? If that is so that is kind of a weird request.</div>
