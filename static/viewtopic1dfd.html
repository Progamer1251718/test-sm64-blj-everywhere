				<div class="content">Hello, I'm Fenlel and I've recently got into speed running sm64. Currently after getting 15 stars on the english version of the game mips seems to not load?, and I was hoping anyone here may have an answer as to why. The current route I use is BoB (1) WF (5) CCM (8) B1 SSL (10) LLL (12) HMC +Toad (15) After grabbing toads star and leaving the room mips seems to not be there. He used to be in previous runs I had but recently he's not been showing up. Any tips would be very helpful thank you all!</div>

				<div class="content">It's because you need to exit a level with 15 stars for Mips to spawn. Since you're grabbing the 15th star from Toad without reloading the castle since Star 14, Mips won't spawn. You need to talk to Toad before grabbing the 15th star from inside HMC.<br /><br />Example: You've collected 13 stars. Talk to toad for your 14th, then re-enter HMC for your 15th. When you exit the level, Mips will appear in the basement.</div>

				<div class="content">Toad spawns at 12 stars so he will be there on your way in to HMC. Just grab him before you jump into HMC.<br />Also, consider learning BitDW reds instead of whatever you do in LLL :)</div>
